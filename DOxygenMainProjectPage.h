/// \section intro Program Introduction
/// The <b>Shape</b> program allows users to create and display information about
/// circles and squares. Users can select a shape, specify its attributes such as
/// color, radius, or side length, and view calculated measurements such as perimeter,
/// area, and overall dimension. The program prompts the user for input, creates 
/// the corresponding shape object, performs the necessary calculations, and displays 
/// the information.
///
///
/// Major Shape project features to note are:
/// 
/// - The program allows users to <b>create</b> and <b>display information</b> about circles and squares 
/// - Users can select a shape from the provided options: <b>Circle or Square</b>
/// - Users can set the shape's attributes, such as <b>color, radius</b> (for circles), or <b>side length</b> (for squares)
/// - The program calculates and displays measurements for the selected shape, <b>including perimeter, area, and overall dimension</b>
///
///
/// That list of major Shape project features are:
/// -# Creation and display of circles and squares 
/// -# Shape selection and attribute setting
/// -# Calculation and display of shape measurements
/// -# Input validation and error handling
/// -# Implementation of shape classes and objects
/// -# Utility functions for user input
///
