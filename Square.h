/// \class Square
///
/// \brief The Square class represents a square shape, derived from the base Shape class.
///
/// This class inherits the name and colour attributes from the Shape class and introduces an additional member variable:
/// - SideLength: Represents the length of each side of the square.
///
/// The Square class overrides the virtual functions defined in the Shape class to provide specific implementations for calculating the perimeter, area, and overall dimension of a square.
